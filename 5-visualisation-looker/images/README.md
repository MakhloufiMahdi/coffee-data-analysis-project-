# Chart: Revenue Over Time

The curve shows the daily evolution of revenue.

A noticeable increase is observed towards the end of the first week (e.g., a peak around January 7–9), which may coincide with a special event or promotion.

There are also low-performance days (e.g., January 13 and 25).

The date range can be adjusted using the filter.
